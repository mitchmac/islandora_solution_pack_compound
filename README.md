SUMMARY
-------

The Islandora Compound Object Solution Pack enables generic parent-child relationships between objects. The object view
of a compound object is replaced by the view of its first child object. The included "Islandora Compound Object
Navigation" block provides a thumbnail navigation of an object's siblings. A "Compound" management tab allows for the
addition and removal of parent and child objects for each object.

------------

Islandora 7.x is required to use the Islandora Compound Object Solution Pack.

Navigation" block at /admin/structure/block.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

CUSTOMIZATION
-------------

The "Islandora Compound Object Navigation" block can be themed. See theme_islandora_compound_prev_next().
